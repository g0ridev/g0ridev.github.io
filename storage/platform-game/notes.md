# Raylib C++ Game Development To-Do List

## Phase 1: Setup & Environment (Day 1-2)

### Get Your Tools Ready
- [ ] **Install raylib**
  - Download from raylib.com or use package manager
  - Test with "Hello World" window
- [ ] **Set up IDE/Build system**
  - VS Code with C++ extension, or Visual Studio, or CLion
  - Configure compiler (g++, clang++, or MSVC)
  - Set up build script (Makefile, CMake, or IDE project)
- [ ] **Create project structure**
  ```
  MyGame/
  ├── src/
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── images/
  │   ├── sounds/
  │   └── fonts/
  ├── build/
  └── README.md
  ```
- [ ] **Version control**
  - Initialize git repo
  - Create .gitignore for C++ projects
  - First commit with basic structure

### Test Your Setup
- [ ] **Raylib "Hello World"**
  - Open a window
  - Draw a circle that follows your mouse
  - Close window with ESC key
- [ ] **Basic input handling**
  - Detect mouse clicks
  - Detect keyboard input
  - Print coordinates/keys to console

## Phase 2: Core Game Loop (Day 3-5)

### Basic Architecture
- [ ] **Main game class/structure**
  ```cpp
  class Game {
  public:
      void Init();
      void Update();
      void Draw();
      void Cleanup();
      bool ShouldClose();
  };
  ```
- [ ] **Game states**
  - Menu state
  - Playing state  
  - Pause state
  - Game over state
- [ ] **Basic game loop**
  ```cpp
  while (!game.ShouldClose()) {
      game.Update();
      BeginDrawing();
      game.Draw();
      EndDrawing();
  }
  ```

### Essential Systems
- [ ] **Input manager**
  - Wrap raylib input functions
  - Handle mouse and keyboard cleanly
- [ ] **Simple renderer**
  - Background drawing
  - Basic shapes (rectangles, circles)
  - Text rendering
- [ ] **Basic audio**
  - Load and play sound effects
  - Background music (optional for now)

## Phase 3: Choose Your Game & Prototype (Day 6-10)

### Pick ONE game idea and stick with it
- [ ] **Decision time:** Write down your chosen game in 2-3 sentences
- [ ] **Core mechanics list:** What are the 3 most important gameplay features?
- [ ] **Win condition:** How does a player win/lose?

### Minimum Viable Game (MVG)
- [ ] **Super basic version**
  - No art, just colored rectangles/circles
  - One core mechanic working
  - Basic win/lose condition
- [ ] **Playable prototype**
  - Can play from start to finish (even if ugly)
  - Basic UI (score, buttons)
  - Restart functionality

### Example for a Card Game:
- [ ] Card representation (just rectangles with text)
- [ ] Deck shuffling and dealing
- [ ] Basic card selection/playing
- [ ] Simple AI opponent or two-player

### Example for Board Game:
- [ ] Grid/board representation
- [ ] Piece placement and movement
- [ ] Turn-based logic
- [ ] Basic AI or two-player

## Phase 4: Polish & Features (Day 11-20)

### Visual Polish
- [ ] **Replace placeholders with art**
  - Draw your own sprites/assets or find free ones
  - Consistent art style
  - Nice color palette
- [ ] **Animations**
  - Smooth piece movement
  - Card flip animations
  - Button hover effects
  - Particle effects for feedback
- [ ] **UI improvements**
  - Better fonts
  - Proper menus
  - Settings screen
  - Instructions/how-to-play

### Game Feel
- [ ] **Audio feedback**
  - Sound effects for actions
  - Background music
  - Audio settings
- [ ] **Juice & polish**
  - Screen shake on impacts
  - Smooth transitions between states
  - Visual feedback for player actions
  - Satisfying animations

### Additional Features
- [ ] **Save/load game state**
- [ ] **High scores or progression**
- [ ] **Multiple difficulty levels**
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts**

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Day 21-25)

### Testing
- [ ] **Playtest with friends**
  - Is it fun?
  - Are the rules clear?
  - Any bugs or crashes?
- [ ] **Bug fixes**
  - Memory leaks
  - Crash conditions
  - Edge cases
- [ ] **Performance optimization**
  - Smooth 60 FPS
  - Reasonable memory usage

### Documentation & Portfolio
- [ ] **README.md**
  - Game description
  - How to build and run
  - Screenshots/GIFs
  - Controls and rules
- [ ] **Code cleanup**
  - Comments for complex parts
  - Consistent naming
  - Remove debug code
- [ ] **Build distribution**
  - Create executable for others to run
  - Package with assets
  - Test on different machines

## Tools You'll Need

### Essential
- **C++ Compiler** (g++, clang++, or Visual Studio)
- **Raylib library** (graphics, input, audio)
- **Text editor/IDE** (VS Code, Visual Studio, CLion, or even Vim)
- **Git** (version control)

### Helpful
- **Image editor** (GIMP, Photoshop, or even MS Paint)
- **Sound editor** (Audacity for sound effects)
- **Build system** (Make, CMake, or IDE project files)

### Free Asset Resources
- **Art**: OpenGameArt.org, itch.io, Kenney.nl
- **Sounds**: freesound.org, zapsplat.com
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts, dafont.com

## Quick Start Commands

### Basic Raylib Setup (Linux/Mac):
```bash
# Install raylib
sudo apt install libraylib-dev  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install raylib             # Mac

# Compile simple program
g++ -o game main.cpp -lraylib -lGL -lm -lpthread -ldl -lrt -lX11
```

### Basic Raylib Setup (Windows):
- Download raylib from website
- Use Visual Studio or MinGW
- Link against raylib libraries

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Goal: 
Working prototype you can play (even if ugly)

### Week 2 Goal: 
Polished version you'd be happy to show someone

### Week 3 Goal: 
Portfolio-ready project with documentation

## Pro Tips

1. **Start SUPER simple** - resist the urge to make it complex at first
2. **Make it playable ASAP** - you can always improve a working game
3. **Test early and often** - run your game every time you make changes  
4. **One feature at a time** - don't try to implement everything at once
5. **Commit often** - save your progress with git regularly
6. **Have fun!** - if you're not enjoying it, try a different game idea

**Next Action:** Pick your development environment and get a basic raylib window running. That's your first milestone!
