//ideas:

how should it look? it says use jekyll??
should i amke it modern looking dark greeyw ith like colorful wriitng?
or shoudl i follow the theme of my bgrande aesthetic, sounds likea lot of effort i doubt ill commit.

so, with intetion ds&a + cpp professional code=> not linked lists yet?
put linked lists learning with the other stuff that would make it more focused on that, the 2nd layer.

// solving it right now...
- lets just slowly figure insertionSort()
- fix the h files,cpp and my own tests
- lets just go through through the several ways to solve insertion sort()
- should we do solve it in a compiler instead of a whole pdf passing on, 
- this makes me people solve it there instead of taking the pdf and walking off with it?
- i feel its less intimidating attacking each one instead of solving it all at once(G4G)
- but you could have it all in one scirpt and connect.
